# **CLASSIFYING HANDWRITING TO ASCII CODE**

Project Summary:
----------------
Our goal is to convert handwritten samples into ascii. We want to compare the efficieny of different machine learning and deep learning models including:
* Random Forest
* XGBoost
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* FeedFoward NN
* Convolutional NM
* Transformer w/CNN Features


Dataset:
-----------
We are using the **AlphaNum** dataset that consist of handwritten letters that are 28x28 pixel images in grayscale.
