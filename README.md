# **CLASSIFYING HANDWRITING TO ASCII CODE**

Project Summary:
----------------
Our goal is to convert handwritten samples into ascii. We want to compare the efficieny of different machine learning and deep learning models including:
Random Forest, XGBoost, FeedFoward NN, CNN, CNN w/ LSTM, and CNN + Transformer


Dataset:
