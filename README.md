# **CLASSIFYING HANDWRITING TO ASCII CODE**

Project Summary:
----------------
Our goal is to convert handwritten samples into ascii. We want to compare the efficieny of different machine learning and deep learning models including:
* Random Forest
* XGBoost
* FeedFoward NN
* CNN, CNN w/ LSTM, and CNN + Transformer


Dataset:
-----------
We are using the **AlphaNum** dataset that consist of handwritten letters that are 28x28 pixel images in grayscale.
