# **CLASSIFYING HANDWRITING TO ASCII CODE**

Project Summary:
----------------
Our goal is to convert handwritten samples into ascii. We want to compare the efficieny of different machine learning and deep learning models including:
-Random Forest
-XGBoost
-FeedFoward NN
-CNN and CNN w/ LSTM 
-CNN + Transformer


Dataset:
-----------
The original dataset can be found at:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lopalp/alphanum/data
We are using handwritten letters that are 28x28 pixel images in grayscale.
