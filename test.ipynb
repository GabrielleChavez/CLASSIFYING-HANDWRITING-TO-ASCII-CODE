But the British text includes the paragraph 7.53-8.11, the Woman taken in Adultery, and this accounts for 178 words out of 279, which is the difference between the 15,695 words of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's.

Mr. Powell, white-faced and outwardly unemotional, replied with a statis- tical statement - and ended by inciting Labour M Ps to angry uproar. One dealt with the human issue behind the Health Service; the other tried to show that the balance-sheet must always come first. \n",

A mediaeval tax was therefore in essence a forced payment whose return was the uncertain bounty of booty and the vague advantages of military glory; it was therefore always granted grudgingly and coupled with the vain hope that, in the words of Parliament after Parliament, the King might 'live of his own resources and carry on his war'. \n",
